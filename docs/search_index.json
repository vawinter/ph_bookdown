Winter 2021-03-15 Chapter 1 Project background What is space-use? The distribution and abundance of individual animals across a heterogeneous landscape is expected to influence population dynamics as a whole (Morales et al. 2010). An animal’s movement through a landscape reflects its perception and reaction to its environment. This movement of individuals occurs in response to the shifting distribution of resources across space and time and ultimately translates into patterns of survival and reproductive success (Gaillard et al. 2010). Space-use behavior reflects spatial and temporal trade-offs an animal must navigate to meet fitness requirements, such as balancing nutritional uptake against predator avoidance (Rosenzweig 1991), and the spatial distribution of individuals is directly linked to dynamics of the population (Fig. 1; Kernohan et al. 2001). The resulting space-use patterns of an individual can offer insights into behavioral and demographic processes affecting population viability, but despite the apparent connection, the link between demographic rates and movement ecology is rarely empirically examined in the literature. Why is this important? Animals exhibit distinct classes of movement behaviors that can vary at different spatiotemporal scales. Migration is one class of annual movement behavior in which individuals will travel between home ranges at seasonal intervals (Dingle and Drake 2007). This alternation between seasonal ranges is hypothesized to be driven by benefits such as reduced predation risk, mating, and increasing access to higher-quality forage (Avgar et al. 2014). Range residency and nomadism are additional classes of movement patterns driven by phenology and landscape factors which dictate range occupancy and alter population distribution strategies (Mueller and Fagan 2008, Mueller et al. 2011). It is by examining these movement patterns that we may gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of an individual’s behavior to population distributions and viability at the seasonal and annual spatiotemporal scale. Why pronghorn? The pronghorn, Antilocapra americana, is North Americas’ only extant endemic ungulate, and has historical ranges within prairie, shrubland-steppe, and desert habitat in the continental west (Berger 2004). Recent population declines across this species wide geographic range have sparked a growing interest in investigating their previously understudied ecology (Beale and Smith 1970, Byers 1997, Poor et al. 2012). Pronghorn population dynamics are being altered by anthropogenic disturbance and climate change (Gedir et al. 2015). These changes are often accompanied by arrested landscape-scale movements. The project I will be investigating pronghorn ecology across space and time while linking variability in space-use patterns to demographic consequences. To do this, I will be using GPS data colelcted over the past several years. By identifying the links between space-use and demography, we will be able to recognize key influential factors that can inform future management of pronghorn as well as other migratory species that share the landscape. "],["Ch.html", "Chapter 2 Establishing a SQL data base", " Chapter 2 Establishing a SQL data base Pronghorn background The pronghorn, Antilocapra americana, is North Americas' only extant endemic ungulate, and has historical ranges within prarie, shrubland -steppe, and desert habitat in the contnental west. Recent population declines across this species geographic range have sparked a growing interest in investigating their previously understudied ecology. In Utah, it is currently unknown if this ungulate still undergoes an annual migration or its seasonal range distribution. Starting in 2016, the UDWR had begun fitting pronghorn with GPS collars as a part of their migration initiative. Using this data, I am to quantify space-use beahvior of pronghorn in Utah by delineating between migratory, resident, and nomiadic behavior of individuals in order to gain a better understanding of their population-level distribution patterns. Here, I will be constructing a SQLIte database containing their individual information (sex, mortality, age, etc.) and tracking information (gps coordinates, sattilites, etc.) using the DBI and RSQLite packages. Getting started First, install and load packages as follows: #install.packages(&quot;RSQLite&quot;) #install.packages(&quot;DBI&quot;) # Load in package library(DBI) # NOTE: as per Hadley Wickham, we often don&#39;t need all the tols in &#39;RSQLite&#39;, so we will laod in &#39;DBI&#39; and call &#39;RSQLite&#39; as needed. Database structure Getting data from collarborators is no small task. For now, the databse structure will appear as follows and updates will be made as data is secured: Figure 2.1: Pronghorn data base structure First: establish the data base connection and load in appropriate .csv's ### Est. database connection --- pronghorn &lt;- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), # Location of saved db &quot;/Users/vermanica/Documents/VW_Final_Prj_RS/Final_prj_RS/Data/pronghorn.db&quot;) class(pronghorn) ## [1] &quot;SQLiteConnection&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;RSQLite&quot; Now, let's set up the two tables. ## Import data to the db --- # Table 1 .csv ph &lt;- read.csv(&quot;/Users/vermanica/Documents/VW_Final_Prj_RS/Final_prj_RS/Data/PH_data/processed_data/ph.csv&quot;) # Table 2 .csv track &lt;- read.csv(&quot;/Users/vermanica/Documents/VW_Final_Prj_RS/Final_prj_RS/Data/PH_data/processed_data/tracking.csv&quot;) ``` Table 1: Pronghorn This is a table that contains all the fixed attributes of the collared individuals. Table 1: Tracking - This is a table that contains all the GPS attributes of the collared individuals. With this data, I hope to be able to delineate migration, determine seasonal home ranges, and eventually perform a survival analysis and model demographics for the Utah population.. Last, let's do some checks to make sure everything worked #Check that it worked --- dbGetQuery(conn = pronghorn, statement = &quot;SELECT* FROM pronghorn LIMIT 10;&quot;) ## ID CollarID mortality sex age_class unit ## 1 PR20F0054 45948 0 F adult North Slope ## 2 PR17F0009 40440 0 F adult Plateau ## 3 PR18F0002 42330 0 F adult Southwest Desert ## 4 PR20M0004 46037 0 M adult West Desert ## 5 PR20F0016 46042 0 F adult West Desert ## 6 PR17M0022 40504 0 M adult Plateau ## 7 PR20M0002 46021 0 M &lt;NA&gt; West Desert ## 8 PR17F0018 40456 0 F adult Plateau ## 9 PR20F0014 46029 0 F &lt;NA&gt; West Desert ## 10 PR17U0004 40495 0 U adult Plateau dbGetQuery(conn = pronghorn, statement = &quot;SELECT* FROM tracking LIMIT 5;&quot;) ## ID lat lon dop ObjectID NumSats Dimension dt ## 1 PR20F0054 40.98637 -109.2109 1.0 22032734 8 3 6/17/20 4:00 ## 2 PR17F0009 38.32036 -111.7530 0.8 22027496 9 3 6/17/20 4:00 ## 3 PR18F0002 38.10193 -112.9547 1.0 22029823 7 3 6/17/20 4:00 ## 4 PR20M0004 40.85842 -112.8552 1.0 22030458 8 3 6/17/20 4:00 ## 5 PR20F0016 40.75581 -112.9860 0.8 22032586 9 3 6/17/20 4:00 Looks good!
